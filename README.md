##  Database Setup

### 1Ô∏è Create Database and Table

A structured database named **`BMW_db`** is created to manage and analyze sales data efficiently.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE BMW_db;
USE BMW_db;

CREATE TABLE bmw_sales (
  Model VARCHAR(20),
  Year INT,
  Region VARCHAR(20),
  Color VARCHAR(20),
  Fuel_Type VARCHAR(20),
  Transmission VARCHAR(50),
  Engine_Size_L FLOAT,
  Mileage_KM INT,
  Price_USD INT,
  Sales_Volume INT,
  Sales_Classification VARCHAR(20)
);
```

### 2Ô∏è Import Data

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'path_to_csv_file.csv'
INTO TABLE bmw_sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```
